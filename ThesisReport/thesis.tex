\chapter{Introduction}

Augmented reality (AR) systems combine standard video inputs with computer-generated objects and
usually provide real-time interaction for the users. 
In general, an augmented reality system can be defined with the following properties \cite{azuma01} :
\begin{itemize}
\item Combination of real and virtual environment
\item Registration (alignment) of real and virtual objects
\item Real-time interaction
\end{itemize}
This concept was pioneered in 1960â€™s by an American computer scientist named Ivan Sutherland
who created the first head-mounted augmented reality
system with the help of one of his students \cite{azuma01}.

Combining virtual objects and annotations with real
world scenes has proved to be an effective way of conveying information about the surrounding environment to
the user and can be useful in many applications such as gaming industry, medical surgeries, tourism and etc.

Many mobile augmented reality systems have been built over the past decades, from touring machine in 1997 \cite{fei97} 
to google AR glasses which was announced in 2013 \cite{google}; however most of these prototypes remained as laboratory prototypes
due to certain difficulties and constraints of using them in practical applications. To name some of the most important constraints
we can refer to \cite{liv05}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The requirement of having more advanced hardware and technology
\item Human factors in augmented reality 
\item Optimization of computational resources inorder to provide a real-time interaction between user and the system
\end{enumerate}

AR systems overlay 2D or 3D virtual objects over real scenes. Therefore, depending on the application usage, certain accuracy would be required for 
registeration of virtual and real objects. There are different approaches to obtain user's location and the position of other objects in the environment.
Tracking sensors such as gyroscope and accelerometer along with video sensors can provide information on the user's position and viewing orientation \cite{azum01}.
In order to find the position of the objects in the scene, a depth map of the surrounding environment at each time would be required. To obtain the depth of the 
objects in the scene several depth sensing technologies can be used such as 3D laser scanner, depth cameras or regular cameras. However, in order to have a mobile AR
system that is easy to carry around, the weight of the whole system will be more of a concern, hence, 3D laser scanners and depth cameras are not good choices for such systems.
Depth cameras such as Kinect or DS325 have certain limitation in viewing range (1m-5m) which would get worse in outdoor environments. On the other hand, 3D laser scanners can
generate very accurate depth maps, but they are normally expensive and their price would range from 500\$ to 50,000\$. Therefore, among all these technologies, using several 
cameras to generate a depth map of the surrounding environment seems to be a more efficient approach for outdoor 3D mobile augmented reality systems. {\newline}
However, using several cameras to get the depth map of the scene requires certain conditions to be met, geometrically and computationally. However, many researchers have already looked into
this particular problem, i.e, finding the 3D position of the points in the scene from two or multiple views using regular cameras. The effort of these researchers have resulted in
certain techniques in computer vision to find the depth of different points in an environment using one or more stereo pairs taken from slightly different points of view of the same scene.
These techniques are known as {\it Stereo Correspondence} or {\it Stereo Matching} \cite{sze11} in computer vision. Stereo matching has been one of the most sutdied subjects in computer vision for 
many years now and there are many solutions proposed by researchers to address this problem using different techniques; however, finding the corresponding pixels in stereo pairs with certain level of 
accuracy and in real-time for practical applications still remains a challenging task. {\newline}

Our motivation in this research is to study the possibility and usability of combining stereo vision approaches with AR systems considering the important constraints that AR systems come across, 
in order to see if stereo vision 
is potentially a good approach for obtaining 3D position of objects in an augmented reality application. The particular application that we are interested in for
our study is a 3D mobile augmented reality system in urban settings. In order to pursue our goal for this research, we have designed and implemented a testbed for evaluation of
stereo matching solutions based on specific criteria which will be described in more details later on in this document.
In the system of our ineterst, the depth map generated from two or multiple camera views will be used as the depth source to find the position of objects in the scene when
overlaying virtual objects at different locations and depth levels in the real environment. For our research we decided to study the effect of using stereo vision in an AR 
system on two of the most important constraints mentioned above, which are {\it human factors} and {\it real-time interaction}. {\newline}
Human perception of depth can vary depending on the environment under different circumstances. Many studies have focused on the evaluation of human perception of depth within different
criteria. One of these areas of study is human perception of depth in augmented reality which has recently attracted more attention. These studies show that the viewer perception of depth
is inversely proportional to his distance from the object \cite{kru10,swa07,jer05,liv05}. In \cite{swa07} some experiments are designed to study and evaluate the human
perception of depth for an outdoor augmented reality application in urban settings. Since the scope of the problem they are interested in is similar to the initial problem domain we 
were motivated by in this research, we have set our criteria for the error in human peception of depth based on their published results and we will consider it as a reference for the 
evaluation of the depth results from stereo matching solutions. \newline
Providing real-time interaction in an AR system for the user requires the processing time and update rate of the whole system to keep up idealy with the standard video frame rate, between 24fps and 
30fps. However, studies show that in practice to build a reasonable interactive augmented world the processing rate should not be less than half of the video frame rate  \textbf{NOTE: Search for more
valid reference} \cite{spe}. There are different approaches to speed up a system. Acceleration of a system is possible in two ways:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Using more advanced technology and hardware
\item More complicated and efficient software design
\end{enumerate}
However, having access to advanced technology and better hardware is not always feasible and even the most advanced technology have some limitation to their memory space and computional capability whic
h may not meet the requirement for some real-time applications. 
Therefore, we have focused more on the second approach while designing our evaluation system which also looks into the 3rd most important property of
an AR system mentioned earlier, i.e, real-time user interaction. \newline 
In fact, one of the most important features that makes our evaluation unique and different from others is that in order to
address the speed factor in augmented reality systems we have decided to focus on certain regions in the scene rather than the whole image for evaluating the depth results. 
This idea which originates from having a more complicated and efficient design, also addresses the computational resources used during the process and may help to speed up our AR system if 
the results show that the decisions made based on these certain regions are reliable enough for later interactions of the user and the augmented world.

(\textbf{NEED SOLID PROOF!}) We believe that in an outdoor augmented reality application there are certain regions in a scene which are more important to human sight and erroneous registeration of virtual and 
real object in those regions can be perceived and picked out easier by the users. Wrong results in these regions can result in poor performance of the system and possibly faulty interaction between 
the user and the augmented world. We have defined these regions to be the depth edges in the scene that have been expanded few pixels from each side. 
Our hypothesis is that the depth edges, which normally includes object boundaries as well, are important depth cues for the user to perceive the depth of different objects in the scene. 
However, the reason for which we decided to extend the detected edges within a few pixels on each side is to also address occlusion and depth discontinuity. Finding correct depth values in these 
regions can lead to more accurate combination of virtual and real objects in the scene and therefore a more reasonable augmented world from the user point of view to interact with. \newline
\newline

Since our objective in this research is to study the combination of stereo vision and augmented reality systems, we have surveyed some of the existing approaches in stereo matching and the
related geometry for 3D reconstruction from stereo pairs. We will go through the related works and background more in the next chapter. 

To evaluate our idea and work in this research, we have decided to assess two stereo matching alogirthms. These algorithms are as follow:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Semi-global stereo matching and mutual information by Hirschmuller \cite{hir08}
\item On building an accurate stereo matching system on graphics hardware \cite{mei11}
\end{enumerate}

The first algorithm by Hirschmuller has already been implemented in Open Source Computer Vision Library (OpenCV) \cite{sgbm}. Therefore, we have used its Opencv implementation that is 
called SGBM. On the other hand, there was no source code available for the second algorithm. So, we have used our own implementation of this solution in the evaluation process, both on CPU and GPU.

The reason we have chosen these two algorithms is that the first method, known as SGM, has shown to generate acceptable results within 1-2 seconds on typical test images \cite{hir08} and 
its implementation in OpenCV library has also made its usage more common and easier in applications. The second algorithm, also known as ADCensus, was chosen since it has been designed in a way that
can be ported to graphics processing unit for accelartion and according to Middleburry evaluation benchmark it is currently ranked as one of the top algorithms for stereo matching \cite{mideval}.
It should also be noted that this solution uses better and more complicated approaches to do stereo matching which makes it superior to many other solutions.
We have used KITTI stereo training dataset \cite{kitti} as our stereo inputs for evaluation. These images are more realistic and they have been taken from outdoor scenes under different circumstances 
and the ground truth disparity map is also provided for each of them which is useful in the evaluation process. KITTI Vision also provides a benchmark and an evaluation table for different stereo 
matching algorithms assessed in real outdoor scenes which makes it more relevant to our interest in this research. AdCensus currently does not exist in their evaluation table and that can be
considered as another reason for us to choose it in our evaluation.


\chapter{Background and Related Works}
Stereo vision is the concept of viewing a scene (object) in the real world from slightly different
viewpoints at the same time which results in stereo image
pairs. Using computer vision techniques, it is possible to extract depth information from stereo
images. This process is called {\it Stereo Matching} or {\it Stereo Correspondence} in computer vision,
which in fact results in the construction of a
3D model of a scene from two or multiple views by finding corresponding pixels and therefore, their spatial movement within various views of the same scene.\cite{sze11}.

Corresponding pixels in stereo images are the ones that represent the same point in the real
world. As it will be seen shortly in more detail, the amount of horizontal motion of such pixels
in stereo pairs, which is referred to as {\it disparity}, is inversely proportional to the
distance from the observer (depth); however,  estimation of the exact depth of the points, requires some
other information as well, such as the position, and the calibration data of the cameras that took the pictures.
While the physical and geometrical approach to this problem is well understood by researchers in the field, the process of finding the corresponding pixels correctly, yet efficiently
and measuring the disparity to generate a dense depth map still remains a challenging task. \newline

\section{Epipolar Geometry}
The basic geometry of stereo matching is described in more detail in this section. 
The epipolar geometry in stereo images is defined by the intersection between the image planes and any plane having the line between two camera centers, known as {\it baseline}, as axis. 
This geometry helps to understand the core idea of stereo matching algorithms and 3D model reconstruction from stereo images.
(\textbf {FIGURE  for epipolar planes similiar to the figure in multipleview geometry page240})

%\end{figure}

If we consider a point P in space and project it back as P' and P'' with rays passing through each camera's centre
into the left and right image planes, there will be a common feature between all these points and the camera centres which serves as an important property while searcing for corresponding points
in stereo matching algorithms. Let us call the plane shared by all these point $\pi$.
Now, suppose that we only know the position of the point P' in the left image and want to find its correspondence, P'', in the right plane. According to the aformentioned property, P',
its correspondence and their projection in 3D space are all coplanar with camera centres. This plane, $\pi$, is defined by the line connecting two camera centres and 
the rays passing through P' and the left camera centre. Therefore, the point P'' would line somewhere on the line of intersection between $\pi$ and the right image plane.
This line is in fact the back-projection in the right image plane of the ray passing through P'. This line is called the {\it epipolar line} corresponding to P'. Hence, in a stereo matching algorithm
we only need to search this line rather than the whole image in order to find the corresponding point for point P'.
There are a few fundamental concepts in epipolar geometry which we will introduce briefly and an illustration of these terminologies can be found in figure \textbf{FIGURE NUMER}
The fundamental entities in epipolar geometry are as follow: \cite{hart2000}
\begin{itemize}
\item The \textbf{epipole}: The point of intesection between the baseline with each of the image planes is called the epipole. In other words, each epipole can be referred to as the image of one of
the camera centre on the other image plane.

\item The \textbf{epipolar plane}: Any plane containing the line between camera centres is called the epipolar plane. The collection of these planes is called an epipolar pencil. 

\item The \textbf{epipolar line}: The intersection of the epipolar plane and the image plane results in a line called epipolar line. The epipolar line always passes through the epipole in the 
image plane.
\end{itemize}

(\textbf{FIGURE HERE FOR EPIPOLAR GEOMETRY TERMS}) 
\newline 
Knowing the concepts in epipolar geometry helps with understanding how stereo correspondence algorithms work. Based on the description of epipolar geometry, 
we know that in order to find the correspondence of a particular point x in the second image plane, first the corresponding epipolar line, which is the projection in the second image plane 
of the ray passing through point x and the centre of the first camera on the second image plane, must be found. Therefore, there is a projective mapping from each point in the first image plane 
to its corresponding epipolar line in the second image, which is represented as matrix that is independant of the scene and is related to the camera's properties.\cite{hart2000} As it can be
seen in figure (\textbf{figure number}), mapping from point P' to its correspondence, P'', in the other image plane requires certain transformations; rotation and translation. However, in order
to make the scanning process more efficient in stereo matching algorithms, it is better to have the input image pairs warped first, i.e., {\it rectified}. The best way to accomplish this task is to
rotate both cameras first so that their optical axis, the line passing through the camera centre which is perpendicular to the image plane, are parallel to each other; 
i.e., their optical axis is perpendicular to the baseline. Furthermore, it is also necessary to have the camera's {\it y} axis perpendicular to the optical axis. These two steps result
in corresponding epipolar lines to be horizontal which constrains the process of searching for the corresponding points. In this model, the disparity for points at infinity is 0.\cite{sze11}
The relation between particular geometrical parameters through which the depth of a certain point in 3D space is obtained, can be clearly defined base on the aforementioed rectified model. 
This relation is presented as follows:
\begin{center}
$d = f\frac{B}{Z}$
\end{center}
where f is the {\it focal length} measured in pixels, B is the {\it baseline}, Z is the {\it 3D depths}, and d is {\it disparity}. The relationship between corresponding pixels in the left
and right images according to disparity {\it d} is as follows:
\begin{center}
${P}''_{x}={P}'_{x}+d(x,y)$

${P}''_{y} = {P}'_{y}$
\end{center}
Therefore, based on the aforementioned formulas, the depth of points in 3D space can be easily calculated after finding the corresponding pixels in multiple views and consequently their
disparities. \cite{bol87,oku93,sch02}

\section{Stereo Correspondence Algorithms}
A survey of the field shows that the algorithms which address stereo correspondence problem can be roughly divided into two main classes \cite{sch02}. These classifications are commonly known as:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sparse Correspondence Algorithms
\item Dense Correspondence Algorithms 
\end{enumerate}

In this section, we are going to briefly describe the important specifications of the algorithms belonging to each of these two classes.
\subsection{Sparse Correspondence Algorithms}
Sparse correspondence algorithms, also known as feature-based algorithms, are the early stereo matching methods. In this type of methods, particular features in an image, such as edge 
points, line segments, and other significant features in an image are extracted and therefore, the search for corresponding pixels is only applied to these regions. Consequently, algorithms of this
type result in a sparse disparity map \cite{matt89,hsie92, sze11}. The introduction of feature-based algorithms has mainly been motivated by three important reasons \cite{sze11}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Limitation in computational resources
\item Constraint of the searching area in order to find more reliable matches
\item Images with different illumination, where edges or some other particular features preserves their photometric properties and therefore, are reliable enough to be used for
correspondence search
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Dense Crrespondence Algorithms}
Unlike feature-based methods, dense correspondence algorithms try to find the
corresponding pixels in the whole image, and therefore, result in a dense disparity map. Most recent algorithms and studies have focused on this class of algorithms since many applications 
nowadays, such as image-based rendering, modeling, or augmented reality require a dense depth map of the scene. This class of algorithms face many challenges that need to be properly
addressed, such as finding the depth values in textureless areas, depth discontinuities, and occluded regions.

Dense correspondence algorithms can be classified in two groups based on how they assign
disparities to pixels:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Local approaches
\item Global approaches
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Local Approaches}
\newline
Local methods try to find the disparity of each pixel based on its local neighboring pixels. In
other words, the disparity of a pixel is calculated in a finite window, based on the intensity values
of neighboring pixels in the same window. \cite{sch02}

These methods make an implicit smoothness assumption for the pixels in the search
window and assign the same disparity to all of them, which could result in incorrect disparity values in slanted surfaces or
depth discontinuities \cite{hirsch02}. This assumption can be considered as one of the major drawbacks of local methods. One
of the other drawbacks of local methods is their dependency on the window size \cite{sch02}. A fixed window size can raise certain problems in these algorithms:
\begin{enumerate}
\item If too large of a window size is considered, due to aforementioned smoothness assumption, the algorithm may result in blurry object boundaries and inaccuracy near depth discontinuities.
\item If the window size chosen is too small, the disparity results will be less accurate since little information has been considered for 
finding the correspondences of pixels in the image.
\end{enumerate}

However, a significant advantage of using local approaches, which is their high speed in finding disparity results.\newline

\textbf {Global Approaches}
\newline
Unlike local approaches, in global methods the disparity of a pixel depends on the information in
the whole image. Global methods usually contain an optimization step of a global energy
function. In this class of algorithms, an optimal disparity value for each pixel is sought that lead to minimization of a global cost
function that normally combines a data term with an explicit smoothness assumption in form of \cite{roy98,bobi99,boyk01}:

\begin{center}
$E(d)=E_{data}(d)+\lambda E_{smooth}(d)$
\end{center}
The term $E_{data}$ normally represent the difference in the intensity of corresponding pixels and is denoted as follows:
\begin{center}
$E_{data}(d) = \sum_{(x,y)}C(x,y,d(x,y))$
where C is the matching cost. The matching cost function can have various definitions depending on the algorithm; however, it is normally defined as sum of absolute difference 
between corresponding pixels intesity in two images \cite{sch02}.

Due to the existence of the smoothness term, $E_{smooth}$, neighboring pixels tend to have similar disparity values. $\lambda$ is also a weight factor that can vary depending 
on the implementation of the global function in the algorithm \cite{sze11}.

\end{center}

The major drawback of global approaches is the high usage of computational resourses and the low speed in finding the matches. However, they usually result in more accurate disparity values
\cite{hirsch02,sze11}.
