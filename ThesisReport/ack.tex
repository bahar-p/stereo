Foremost, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my supervisor, Dr. Oscar Meruvia-Pastor, for his continuous support, motivation, insightful advice and 
kind guidance throughout my research program. This 
thesis would have not been possible without the generous resources provided by him, the Department of Computer Science, and Memorial University.

I would like to express my heartfelt appreciation to Dr. Sam Bromley for his patience, constant encouragement, and insightful, challenging comments which compelled me to always
do better.

I am deeply grateful to my family who never stopped supporting me throughout all my studies, even when we were far from each other. I would have never been the person I am today if 
it was not for their unconditional support.

Last but not the least, I want to thank my fellow labmates in Computer Vision Lab for the interesting ideas we shared, for all the sleepless nights we spent together before deadlines, 
and for all the fun we had together in the last two years. Studying in Memorial University along with my peers in the department has been a great experience for me
and is absolutely an unforgettable memory.
