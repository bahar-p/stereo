\chapter{Introduction}

Augmented reality (AR) systems combine standard video inputs with computer-generated objects and
usually provide real-time interaction for the users. 
In general, an augmented reality system can be defined with the following properties \cite{azuma01} :
\begin{itemize}
\item Combination of real and virtual environment
\item Registration (alignment) of real and virtual objects
\item Real-time interaction
\end{itemize}
This concept was pioneered in the 1960s by an American computer scientist named Ivan Sutherland
who created the first head-mounted augmented reality
system with the help of one of his students \cite{azuma01}.

Combining virtual objects and annotations with real
world scenes has proved to be an effective way of conveying information about the surrounding environment to
the user and can be useful in many applications such as gaming, medical surgeries, tourism, and other entertaining, informative or instructional tasks.

Many mobile augmented reality systems have been built over the past decades, from touring machine in 1997 \cite{fei97}
